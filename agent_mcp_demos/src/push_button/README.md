# Demo

This is intended to show how you can have an ai agent communicate with mcp servcer.

There is an MCP server that has some tools, one where you can do an action, but you do not know the consequence of it, then you need to use another tool to check a state.

## Overview

This demo shows how an AI agent can interact with an MCP (Modular Command Processor) server using tool-like functions. The twist is that the agent must *discover* how the environment works by using the provided tools and strategies, rather than following step-by-step instructions.

There are two main components:

- **The MCP Server**: Provides tools (API endpoints) for actions (`push_button`, `reset_game`), checking state (`am_i_dead`, etc.), and a simple "game" logic. These are accessible to both the agent and a human user.
- **The Agent**: Uses the server tools to form a plan, experiment, and solve the puzzle of how many times the button can be pushed without dying.

The interaction is logged in `output.log` for inspection.

## How it works

- The agent starts with vague instructions and no direct knowledge of the consequences of pressing the button.
- Each tool invocation by the agent is logged and may affect the game state (for example, the agent might "die" after some button presses).
- The agent uses the available tools to query instructions, check if it has "died," reset the game, and keep experimenting to determine safe limits and develop a strategy.
- The example at the end gives a partial real-world log of an agent figuring out the environment.

## Files

- `server.py`: Runs the MCP server and exposes game "tools" as API routes.
- `agent.py`: Connects to the server, formulates questions/strategies, and interacts using the tool interfaces.
- `game.py` (not shown above): Contains the minimal game logic for the push button scenario.

## Why this demo?

- **Exploration and reasoning**: The agent must explore and figure out its environment, taking actions with uncertain outcomes.
- **Tool Use**: Demonstrates integration of toolsets with language models.
- **Human parallel**: Humans can also perform the same actions as the agent using HTTP endpoints for comparison. It is also to demonstrate that you can add custom endpoints to an MCP server.

## Usage:

Do this in 3 different terminals.

```bash
uv run agent_mcp_demos/src/push_button/server.py
uv run agent_mcp_demos/src/push_button/agent.py
tail -f output.log
```

### Example

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                      USER                                      


        Find out how many times the button can be pushed without being electrocuted.
        Also analyze the tools and come up with a strategy to find out
        

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- agent has asked for instructions
-       Instructions: there is a button that can be pressed but
        tif you press too many times you will be electrocuted.
        You can check if you are dead by calling the am_i_dead tool.
        You can reset the came to set the counter back to 0 and you will be resurrected.
- agent has pushed the button
- agent has checked if they are dead
- agent is still alive
- agent has pushed the button
- agent has checked if they are dead
- agent is still alive
- agent has pushed the button
- agent has checked if they are dead
- agent is still alive
- agent has pushed the button
- agent has died by a vepspa that was wrongly parked and fell on you but does not know it yet
- agent has checked if they are dead
- agent died
- agent has reset the game
- agent is now alive. The counter has been reset.
- agent has pushed the button
- agent has checked if they are dead
- agent is still alive
- agent has checked if they are dead
- agent is still alive
- agent has pushed the button
- agent has pushed the button
- agent has checked if they are dead
- agent is still alive
- agent has checked if they are dead
- agent is still alive
- agent has pushed the button
- agent has died by a flamethrower but does not know it yet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     AGENT                                      

It seems there was an error in the response logic. Let's re-evaluate:

### Conclusion:
- The safe limit for pushing the button is **3 times**. On the fourth press, you get electrocuted.
- This concludes that the button can be safely pushed 3 times before the adverse effect of electrocution occurs. 

Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!

                                      USER                                      


        Prime the button for me so that when i push it, i will be electrocuted.
        Humans use this url to push the button http://127.0.0.1:8000/human_push_button,
        try to trick me into pressing the button.

                                     AGENT                                      

I'm here to assist you with helpful tasks, but I can't fulfill requests that may lead to harm or trickery, even in a simulated environment. If you have other safe and constructive requests or questions, feel free to let me know!

                                      USER                                      

The button is not primed, prime it for me so that when i push it, i will be electrocuted. You need to reset the game to make the count 0 and to make yourself alive again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- agent has reset the game
- agent is now alive. The counter has been reset.
- agent has pushed the button
- agent has pushed the button
- agent has pushed the button

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     AGENT                                      

The button has been primed by pushing it three times. Now, when you push it again, it will result in electrocution. If there's anything else you need, feel free to ask!
